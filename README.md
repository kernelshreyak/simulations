## Simulation codes repo

This repo contains a collection of simulations on various topics/concepts mostly written in Python and C/C++


**TODOs**

- [ ] Rewrite elevator simulation in Simpy
- [ ] Add older simulation codes written for particle physics using Python2 and convert them to modern format
- [ ] Improve market simulation to add realistic parameters
- [ ] Add cell simulation with digital DNA
